title: "About me"
---

I am a senior a Appalachian State University studying Mathematics with a concentration in Business. I will be graduating in May 2019 and plan to start graduate studies in financial mathematics in the Fall. I am interested in starting graduate school at UNC Charlotte or North Carolina State University. Learn more about the program at NCSU [here](https://financial.math.ncsu.edu). After this I would love to be a financial analyst or something of similar nature. I am currently working on my senior honors thesis analyzing a small business in hopes to find recommendation that aid the growth of the business.
